# Graphics Projects

Project specs and starter files found on https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-837-computer-graphics-fall-2012/

In order to run, MIT's vecmath.h library can be found here: https://github.com/ydm/mit-vecmath

To use, run `make` then `sudo make install` I know it works on Linux but not sure about anything else
